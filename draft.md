# Introduction

Current common codon models of sequence evolution assume changes with a codon happen as single, instantaneous changes. Simplifies computation. Introducing multiple instantaneous hits is a relatively new thing.

codon islands specifically serine

we present a model that allows for single, double and triple instantaneous changes within a codon. Test its performance with simulations and empirical data. See if allowing triple hits changes the inference of positive selection and how the fit of the models compares. Basic MG94 type codon model modified to include rate variation across sites and double and triple hits.

? Was the Double Hit model published before? If so what was it used for?
